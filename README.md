This is a web-site where any user can come and test their typing speed. 

Every user will have to type as many random (English) words as they can, in a fixed time frame - this will be used to calculate their speed.

An on-screen keyboard is also provided, so that user can know if he/she has correctly typed the highlighted letter (of a word) or not. (If they have typed correctly, the same letter get highlighted in "green" colour on the on-screen keyboard, else it will be highlighted in "red" colour.

HTML, CSS and JS were used to built this web-site.
